The average availability of the shared room is around 200 days but unlike brooklyn here the average avaliability of the private room and entire home/apt is around 100 days.\n",
    "2. No of listings of shared room are limited but thier average price is placed less and average avalaiability high around 200 days.\n",
    "3. Minimum no of nights to stay reduces with increase in price. From price around 250\\$ minimum nights will not be an issue.\n",
    "4. No of reviews and reviews per month are more at less price than higher price as there is less chance of people going for a high priced rooms.\n",
    "5. similar to brooklyn spread of availability is high at low prices and at higher price the avaliability is either very less or very high.\n",
    "6. At low prices some listings are having high value for days since last review which means every person who rents might not rate the residence. But when combined with no of reviews and reviews per month it tells us how frequently that room is being rated.\n",
